"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","It is a powerbank with good camera, storage and average phone features.",1.0,"My review after three months use:I am reducing it to one stars after three months use. Initially I gave five star. Reasons of giving one star is:1) the phone is over priced and it's actual price should be not more than 13-14K.2) occassionally it's back panel heats up.3) design is poor, especially at the back camera panel space above the flashlight is unutilized and don't look premium. Much cheaper mobile phones have better design.3) the whole body including screen, back panel and camera panel is very sensitive to scratches. You have to cover with phone case and screen guard immediately otherwise your phone will give a dirty look full if scrates after one week use.3) no IP rating. Forget water proofing, not a trace of water resistance. You have to prevent it from humidity and sweating.4) screen refresh rate is poor in comparison to other phones available below 10K range.Following was my review after almost one week use. __________________________________At first glance it looks a bit bulky. Camera, display etc. are satisfactory. Overall GOOD non Chinese phone.However, for their improvement, I tried to give some critical feedback to the company over phone but it was not so easy, so, I am writing here sothat Samsung India can take this critical review for their improvement.Battery:Battery is 7K mha but it is draining so fast that its overall backup time is slightly better than any other average phone.User Interface:User interface needs tremendous improvement. You can't take screenshot easily. You need to learn fine motor coordination between your fingers and power&volume button with microsecond precision. After three days I discovered taking screenshot by swapping screen. But this easy method for taking screenshot is not easy to find in its setting section. Automatic redial isn't available. also in setting section, searching for basic operation like redial, call waiting etc are either missing or very difficult to access. UI should be more intelligent and intuitive. Call recording should take permission from user before it starts recording any call.Dolby Sound:Dolby sound effect is excellent but its available only for external speaker. Inbuilt speaker don't have Dolby effect. You hv to buy headphone or external speaker for experiencing Dolby sound effect. Its Dolby software is so impressive that its work on a cheapest headphone but Samsung's own inbuilt speaker doesn't.External Outlook:Read somewhere that this phone has 3D prism like glastic body. GLASTIC seems to be a discovery of new material (Glass+Plastic) because its looks transparent and shining. But in reality, its a cheap looking smooth and slippery plastic back body. Also, Its prone to scratches neither its water resistant. Sometimes it generates heat. In this price segment, Samsung can easily provide metallic back for better appearance and transfer of heat.Overall, its good non chini phone with good camera and display, a bit bulky, satisfactory speed, scope of tremendous improvement in UI and setting, and bit overpriced."

"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Pls don't buy.. cheap quality feeling waste of 25k money,1.0,"Genuine Feedback to samsung and all buyersNot Upto the Mark..Battery is good, but mobile is very heavy.. not handy for one hand operation.. if you use it continuously then you feel pain in your  hand, designed is out dated, poor quality material.. camera is just okay..I am not happy overall performance of this phone at this price band...Mobile should be perfect for 15-16k price band..Lookwise not goodDisplay qaulity is just good not bestSound quality is goodCamera not much good that I am expecting.Big screen which perfect for movie watcher.. but after 30 minutes you feel pain in your hands.I bought Electric blue colour, it's look like samsung old samrt phone .My request to Amazon, is it possible to return this mobile. Then help me for return...I am not happy with overall performance of the phone..."
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",One of the best phones at affordable price...,5.0,"Ok so here comes the first review of this phone. Ordered on the first day of its sale and received on 3rd day. Indeed its a big and bulky phn but easy to handle. Few highlights:1. Seamless fingerprint scanner. I hv heard tht recent samsung phns have ths issue , however i dnt see any in ths phn. Its as gud as my past phns Asus 6z and Vivo v15pro. Side fingerprint scanner on the power button really makes it stylish and too easy to handle as well.2. Camera quality is really gud wth many features which luks tempting which im yet to explore. Even in dim light it scores quite well. Have all latest features like slow mo, 10x zoom, focus lens, panorma view and other added features.3. Battery ofcourse was the highlight while buying ths phn. I received this phn at 43%. And even after a rigorous 3 hr session of data transfer and apps installation it still holds at 33%. I believe it gonna last 2 days easily wth heavy net usage , mild games and gud 2 hrs of talk time.4. Luks wise it does seem premium despite a plastic back.5. Wonderful touch and a decent processimg speed. I tried playing 7-8 apps at the same time and it never hanged or lagged despite 50% memory up. Yet to try on heavy games though.6. Front cam does spoil the fun while watching full screen videos, like a small black dot bt can be lived wth.7. No headphones in the box.8. C to C charging cable capable of reverse charging too.Overall i wld rate it 4/5. Its one of the best non chinese phn available in the market for those who r luking for a huge battery wth a decent cam and light gaming purpose.Wld update on battery and cam after few days of usage"
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Don't buy this product. Even the most basic things are faulty,1.0,"There's something wrong with the new Samsung M51 mobile. Many other users are also facing the same issue. We are unable to connect through Wi-Fi on Samsung M51.Meanest Monster Ever ... HahahahaThis meanest monster is performing poorly within 5 min of unboxing. My eight yr old Lenovo still works like charm with Wi-Fi.Issue: When you trying connecting through Wi-Fi, on giving correct password, it says ""Incorrect Password"".I have done every troubleshooting step suggested by Samsung Tech support:1. Forget the connection and reconnect again.2. Update the phone s/w to latest version.3. Reset Settings4. Reset Network Settings5. Factory Data ResetI have applied every step suggested by tech-support and the result is still the same.The most irritating thing is how can a company like Samsung mess-up such a basic feature & to the surprise, even the tech support has now run out of troubleshooting solutions.Instead of replacing it with new phone, tech support has now told me to get the hardware fixed from Samsung Service centre. I don't get it why should I take a brand new phone to service center & get it opened. Instead a replacement of this phone should be there, I have not even used it for more than an hour.Last year I ordered an MI phone from Flipkart, the battery was getting drained very fast. Within the next day, the phone was replaced without questions asked.Dissappointed by Amazon, the way they are handling this issue.Don't spend your hard-earned money on this phone. Unfortunately, if your phone turns-out to be faulty, then there is a never ending process to take care of issue."
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Not worth,1.0,"Usually I don't write the reviews, but this time I couldn't resist myself from doing so.First of all, I am a Samsung hater, but my wife didn't want a chinese brand phone, so I had no option than to go with Samsung. Therefore, this review may look like bias, but believe me, it's not.Doesn't look like a 27K phone. Screen looks so dull compared to my 3 years old one plus 5t phone. UI is boring. Stock android would have been appreciated. 3 finger screenshot feature is not available (though there are other ways, this one is easiest). Out of 8Gb 3.2Gb RAM was showing as used out of the box. Out of 128Gb , 32Gb was showing as used. Neither of the camera was impressive. There are some default apps (bloatware) which are absolutely useless. They didn't even provide the silicon transparent cover with the phone. The only good thing about this phone is - it is very bulky (this is not the sarcasm, I really like bulky phones)Anyway, I won't be using this phone, but feeling very bad that I spent this much of money for such a cheap phone 😥"
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Average Phone at Over Price with some bugs,2.0,"I am giving this review after spending 20 days with this Phone. I am a retail user and after 6 year of redmi and realme user now buy the Samsung just because of Samsung+Snapdragon and very much dispointed. Here are some Pros and Cons which will help other user like me to decide whether they will buy it or not.Cons :1. No Haptic Feedback2. Low sound quality speaker at Rs 25K3. No apps lock features inbuilt4. No Case Cover in Box5. Plain Plastic back design at 25K which attract too much scratches.6. Samsung trusted Knox security not fully enable on this phone i.e no secure folder option.7. When Sealed Package open then phone display contain so much dust. Not expected the packaging like this from brand like Samsung.8. Gorila Glass 3 protection under 25k i.e out dated glass protection after using 2 days with full care i got one scratch mark on display.9. NFC given but Samsung Pay not there in this phone.10. Audio output in my boat rockers bluetooth headset with this phone is not as much as lound as compare to my previous phone Redmi Note 7 pro.11. Without using phone it take 2 hour to charge but when you use it frequently then it take 2.30-3 hour to charged it full from 0-100%.12. Full battery drained in 12 hour with non stop used including youtube, whatsapp Facebook, messaging, etc except game.13. No Carrier aggregation: Using Jio sim in Samsung M51 and realme X2 pro and both contain different net speed in which Samsung giving me 5mbps and realme x2 pro giving me 9-10mbps.14. Calling issue: while talking through ear piece on call, the person can hear my voice clearly. But if i put the call on loudspeaker, the receiver of call cant hear my voice or he hear my sound very low. Turning back to earpiece the person is able to hear me again.15. Camera Zoom quality is not good. When you focus on Sky whole pic turn into blue. i.e saturation level is too much high in this phone (Image attached).16. While watching movie video in this phone or playing video in youtube brightness fluctuate fast too much automatically i.e Adaptive Brightness issue.Pros :1. Super amoled plus display2. Camera quality Good3. 7000 Mah battery4. Till now Ram management is goodTo much hype created every where for this phone and due to this many user like me has purchased this phone but this phone under 25k is really not value for money. I am going to resale this phone. There are so many phone below 25k with best facilities as compare to this Samsung m51.Conclusion : Phone is overpriced and performance is average"
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Poor call quality and microphone,1.0,"Call quality is poor. When loud speaker is on, Cannot hear properly on the other side, call is muffled or breaking. Do someone else face this similar issue ? Is there any way to fix. I could not raise a ticket to contact either Amazon or samsung. Camera quality is also average.  Hated it.Updated review after 20 daysStarted facing charging issuesStopped charging suddenly, don't know what to doNo more replacement from AmazonNice lesson learnt:1. Don't fall into the trap of extensive hype of a product2. Don't believe youtubers reviews just before experiencing atleast 30 days of usage.3. Don't buy a product on its first day of launch4. Read the return and replacement policy thoroughly before buying."
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Please avoid this phone,1.0,"1.On playing games, sound is too too less.2.Flash light too dull3. 7000Mah battery, all fake battery only last one day or one and a half day max4. There is no Broadband speed  indicator5.live wallpaper option not goodBetter avoid this phone, dont fall for advertisements"
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",MONSTER FOR ALL CHINESE MOBILES,5.0,"This is a perfect mobile for you,1. If you properly read the spec before buying this mobile2. If you don't expect all iPhone features in this mobile,3. if you are not a addictive gamer,4. If you don't expect your mobile to be a speaker,5. If you do concern about your data handled in Chinese mobiles,6. If you need better SAR value,7. If your first preference is battery, and decent level of camera quality,8. If you need all trending features to be covered in non Chinese mobile,THEN GO FOR IT... ALSO TRY TO UPDATE TO LATEST SOFTWARE ONCE AFTER SETTING UP YOUR MOBILE, OTHERWISE HEATING ISSUE WILL BE THERE."
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Superior Phone from samsung at budget rate.,5.0,"After using for more than 2 day's I must say, snapdragon 730g works wonderful .CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mega Pixcel and more feature in selfie camera.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M51 feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. 6.7 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also."
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Issues with camera. Unhappy with samsung.,2.0,"It has issue with camera in night mode and pro mode.It seems like there is dust present on camera sensor which is only visible in dark photos. When photo is clicked with lens covered completely,  it shows hundreds of white spots in image, same happens with pro mode too. (This is not regular image noise)"
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","Not a monster, but a good deal.",5.0,"My take after using the handset for 4 days:1. Display: Superb. Big, crystal clear, bright and everything you can expect from a samsung super amoled plus screen.2. Camera: Very good. Night mode could have been better.3. Sound: Speakers: Better than average, earphones: good4. Battery: Very good. But expected more backup from a 7000 mah battery. Had to charge it once a day for the last 4 days.5. UI: The one-ui provided here is different from the one provided in A series. The one that comes with A series phones like A50 etc is more user friendly and has more features like Secure folder, timer etc. Also, the Samsung notes app in A series is far better than the one provided here. In this price, an UI at par with the leading A series phones is expected.6. Processor: Good for normal use.7. Finger print unlock is fast and smooth.8. No case/ back cover and no earphone.9. A bit overpriced."
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",It's a wonderfull but wait...,1.0,"I have been using this from starting. Ordered on 18th sep and get this phone very next day 19th. Here is my overall review.1. Battery - tremendous and optimization is on next level2. Display - It's great display ever.3. Speed - faster then ever ( compared to my other phones )4. Gaming - Very powerful no laging ( played COD, Hitman Sniper, Asphalt 9)But wait, in the meantime I've faced some issues on the phone as well.1. Voice call - call is fine but when call is placed on speaker children voice could not be heard by other. On normal call it's perfect but on speaker it's not. Adult voice can be heard from a distance but children voice can't. even the phone is just near the face. This issue can lead you the problem while you're on whatsapp video call as well. First I thought it was just whatsapp issue but after certain test it's major issue on voice call. Tested with safe mode and also after factory reset (without any other third party applications)2. Fingerprint sensor - It's fine and fast. But wait. you need to setup both hands fingers so it's easy to use. Maybe if the finger print sensor placed on in-display then it's better than this but if you map with both hand fingers and thumb then it's easy. Other wise you've to wait for 30 seconds if the finger not matched for 5 times.3. Galaxy Apps - Disable it otherwise unnecessary apps and bloatware will be install automatically.4. Knox - It's displaying secured by Knox but secure folder is not there. Which should be.I have replaced the product but still the microphone issue is there so plz be carefull with this."
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Bang for your Bucks! Just a few updates and tweaks required.,4.0,"Initial experiences:- Adaptive brightness/ Ambient Display: Frequent screen flickering and unstable; had to disable.- Fingerprint Scanner: Poor quality, frequently asks you to wipe..- No preapplied screen film or back-case supplied.+ Nice AMOLED panel and crisp viewing experience.+ Not bulky or uneasy to hold contrary to common perception.+ Biiig battery which lasts looong.+ Good reception and call quality.+ Not Chinese+ Better than Oneplus Nord (don't look at 5G, let our 4Gs work efficiently as of now!)+ Top notch performance."
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Phone is just ok ok...,3.0,"1. NO secure folder option, This phone SUCKS.2.Processor is old same as A80 (launched in April 19)2. Display is Good3. Back Panel (it's plastic wanna be glass;) , watch it on the first and last time at unboxing cause it won't be same anymore)4. Not Camera monster it's a camera average, they show 64 MP its 64 MP, which takes 3-6 seconds for one snap. Till then moment is already gone.5. Battery works only for a day.For 27K it doesn't worth it.Don't buy it, seriously."
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",24Hrs Review,3.0,"Camera - GoodFast charge - GoodDisplay - AwesomePerformance - GreatBattery Backup - It's Not Like 7000mah, Average ( Like 4000mah ) Need Optimization2-3 times Play Store Getting Crashed....Otherwise Good to Buy.......Amazon very good Delivery.......NoEarphone And Softcase"
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",A decent midrange phone. Happy with the mobile.,5.0,"First impressions: the celestial black colour looks really good and elegant. Looks better than in pics or videos. The phone feels solid in hand. The screen is large and great quality punchy colors. The screen is also very bright.Performance too seems good except that the real performance will be known a while later as Samsung mobile tend to slow down with time. The back is a fingerprint magnet, so a case is a must.The battery is really a beast and charger is decent too. Battery easily lasts 2 days with average use, even with heavy use it lasts one and a half days.Camera Performance is great at this price. The pictures and videos come out great.I got the 6gb variant with hdfc offer and with HDFC smart buy, the price should come down to 22000. Its a great phone at this price. Most of the cons mentioned in online reviews are not for me. I am happy with this phone.Why I preferred M51 over Nord? M51 ticks all the right boxes for me. A great screen for watching videos, good casual gaming, a great battery lasting at least 2 days, a better camera, 128 gb storage with microsd card support  and at a price which is Rs. 3000  cheaper. I already have Samsung and Oneplus phones at home. So I can say with confidence that you won't go wrong with any of the brand.My overall first impression is that its a great phone with almost all things that one may need at this price. Will keep updating."
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","High Priced, SAR value and Vibration is more, I won't recommend this (Review after 6 days usage)",1.0,"I have ordered this mobile on the first day of the sale at 12 o clock sharp. Yes there are some good features, But let's talk only about the CONS. The reason for talking about the CONS as the PROS are talked by other friends.  1) Vibration of the mobile is more and can't hold the mobile for longer time.  2) Mobile is higher priced compared to other same configuration devices and no tempered glass or case has been provided.  3) Guys Please check the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR Value) before buy any mobile and in this its more which affects Head and Body and not good for health.  4) Weight of the mobile is MORE and finally I won't recommend this."
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Loudspeaker and mic issue,1.0,I received the phone on the very next day of the sale.Unfortunately I am facing issue with loudspeaker and mic. So the primary thing of a phone (calling) is not working properly.Even after replacement facing the same issue.
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Overall good product,4.0,"Charging and display quality is good..No hangsHeating is not obsereved during charging or using mobile.Diasble galaxy store otherwise bloatware is installed continuously.I didn't find mobile is heavy , weight management is excellent. Otherwise it's as usual normal android.. phone.. camera I didn't like much both front and back useless. I purchased this phone esp for display and battery. For small hands mobile is bit tall not width wise..Macro photo lots of granules seeing..

"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Good battery life,5.0,Great phone with good battery life the battery usually lasts for 2 days on light usage and charges super quick
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Got a defective piece and on Amazon is getting replaces is also painful,1.0,"Samsung delivered defective piece and had to gone through replacement cycle. Believe me, on Amazon getting replacement is not easy.  It was a manufacturing defect.Do see your phone thoroughly, as soon as you receive to check for defect.*** Amazon has no return policy on electronic items, even if product is damaged. They dont care. ***Finally after getting product :Camera, User Interface : GoodHeavy (because of mega battery). Its a big phone, so personally I am not finding it handy.Battery life : still need to find."
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Best Phone under 25k,5.0,"Pros:1. Value for money buy at 23k considering the offers.Try to get it at this price range by bank offers being offered.2. Camera is brilliant.Compared to OnePlus Nord and others in this price range.3. Snapdragon 730G optimized very well.Processor is snappy.Compared to other brands (realme 7 pro, one plus nord), it gives faster perfomance as it has been properly optimized.4. Battery is the top selling point for this phone.I have to take office calls for 5/6 hours a day, including webex meetings with wifi always on.It still last me 1.5 days.5. Display is excellent even though it is providing 60 hz refresh rate.Amoled display of samsung is brilliant as always.Cons:1. Back is plastic. Does feeling like a 25k phone.But as 7000mah battery had to be adjusted in a compact way, samsung had to compromise  with the design.2. 4k/1080p videos can't  record in 60fps.Doesn't  bother me much, it depends on your preference."
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Worth the price,5.0,"This is the best phone in 25000 segment  730G processor with 7000 mah battery with 25w fast chargingThe display quality is amazing as it is S amoled panelThe 64 mp camera captures amazing details it also has night mode and slowmo, hyperlapse, one take, macro camera is not good tho . It tried fortnite it can run on medium graphics with 30fps limit and its pretty smooth thanks to 730G . The front facing camera quality is very good  i have attached pic of  ram usuage with no background app running one thing i didnt like was u cannot zoom in when u set to 64mp camera mode and it is filled with unnecessary apps like daily hunt and many others"
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","Little high-priced, very good battery, camera and a satisfactory performance (Review after 5 days)",3.0,"Well, as compared to the same feature range phones. The price seems to be 2-3k high. But if you are bored of charging your phone every 6 hours, you have a relief here with 7000 mAh battery, which doesn't  disappoint you.  I choose primarily for the battery and it lived up to the point that it stated. With playing 1 hour of playing COD, using hotspot for a full day and browsing it lasted for more then 40 hours and there is a battery saver mode too, which will last for a week if you are travelling out and need to use phone for only call and minimum usage.But, if you are a non-stop gamer it will last a day depending on the usage.Pros:Display is good, performance is fine, battery is stand out. The camera is also good and bixby vision is cool. Many edited features come with the camera, that is added advantage. Sensors are good and fast too. The weight is well balanced, you won't feel the weight after a day's usage. Charging is quite quick. Rest of phone's features are fine.Cons:Plastic built body, no tempered glass or case is provided within the box. The speakers are located at the bottom which is uncomfortable if we hold the phone in two hands and watch videos or play games. In dark, the screen display may cause some burden to the eyes, which I did not face earlier. The background apps keeps running until you close them or optimize the battery which will automatically close all the background running appVerdict:Little high-priced, very good battery and a satisfactory performance."
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Thoughts before buying 🤔,3.0,"Awesome phone..all good reviews..1.definitely heavy, what else u can expect with huge 7000 battery, yet manageable.. u cant hold and watch movies or matches for long u need a stand..have to use Bluetooth or wired headset while talking as its heavy, u feel it slips off2. Stunning display amoled at its best..watched Enola holmes3. need back cover else scratches will be evident glaringly and lose its premium feelMost important worrying fact is SAR value at 1.3, the only fact I am disappointed with samsung..u can check dailling *#07#..ps samsung are valued for low sarAudio loud speaker I am not satisfied"
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","Price reduced from 24,999 to 19,999. Huge difference. Feeling cheated.",1.0,"Ibought it for 24,999 but now it's 19,499. Cheap phone but samsung looted me. Be aware of foreign countries. Either is Chinese or any other."
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",My Worst Ever Online Purchase,1.0,"I have been using Samsung Phones ever since they ventured into Smart Phones. I had privilege of using majority of Samsung Phones like Galaxy S2, Samsung Grand, Samsung S6, Samsung S9+, Samsung Note 3 and Samsung S10.When Samsung launched M51, like many I think I am also fooled by aggressive marketing campaign and youtube reviews by youtubers like Technical Guruji (I unsubscribed his channel due to fraud review)Why I purchased this phone because ofBrand SamsungExpected Good Camera SetupExpected Good Build QualityExpected Good PackagingAnd for this I have paid good price of INR 25KWhy I am disappointedBuild quality is quite inferior it's cheap plastic that use to come in phones like Karbon or Lava in 2012-2013.Camera setup is quite average, they say it's triple camera but picture quality is not so great, night shots are average, I think if you buy brands like Xiaomi you get better pictures by spending less amount. Probably that's why Samsung is marketing Single Take feature, which I think won't work if camera is average.Packaging, after paying INR 25K one expects box to include stuff like Phone Cover as these days majority of manufacturers, but here it comes with cheap quality of Box, that has nothing but a cheap charger with very poor quality of packaging, now a days many manufacturers are also putting the screen protectors at cheap cost, Samsung should take a note.Phone weighs quite heavy and is not easy to use with one hand, this is something nobody is telling, probably thats the only reason Samsung has degraded the build quality.What is good about this phoneBattery - Certainly that's the only feature for which I paid INR 25K. But are you willing to pay this much for a phone that's more of power bank.Headphone Jack - Samsung has retained it, and it's output is pretty good.Apart from that phone has same processor like Samsung A80, which comes with better camera setup and better build quality.Therefore I feel Samsung is over charging customers for this device and it should not cost more then INR 15K - 18K.So if you are only looking for battery and headphone jack then spend money on this one and If anyone wants to contact me I am ready to resell mine at 20%  discount.I wish they had option of giving zero stars.Amazon I am sorry this is my worst ever Amazon shopping experience which I regret everyday when I see what I got."

I do not game heavily or photograph heavily.To me the best part about it is the display. I've never used an OLED display and moving from standard LCD to OLED is magical. The system wide dark mode support makes everything look sexy black!The battery is super powerful, although I've to use it for more days to give a better review. From what I experienced, you can easily get 12-15 hours of screentime at least, spanning over 2 days. The charging is as advertised, taking around 2 hours for a full charge.I'm not a camera enthusiast beyond some selfies and occasional landscape photography when I travel. The camera provided satisfied my expectations. Please look at same photographs attached, bearing in mind that light conditions were not optimal and I'm not an expert at the art. Also, it has Cam2 API support, so you can install a Google Camera mod and tweak the settings to your liking.This phone is worth it for the display and battery for me. It has everything I expected. Only disappointment is that it doesn't come with a cover or screenguard, while other manufacturers provide that even at this range."

"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Samsung one month usage review | IemMihir,5.0,Straight to the point :Purchased in first saleReceived : 20sep2020- Really heavy can start wrist pain if not used properly (but including 7000mah in this weight is surprisingly excellent. Kudos to samsung)- Headphone jack is a boon ...although I use TWS but a headphone jack is a must.- Battery can be stretched more than 1.5 days with normal usage. But initially need to disable every background app to get optimized battery life.- Glastic back panel is shiny but will not give premium feel.- Fingerprint is decent but getting used to side mount will take time.- Not for osmo mobile 3 (which I have tested and also try to upload video) uncomfortable to load and unload.- Excellent camera and video esp macro- Selfie cam is also good- Requires some adaptor to charge old phones. Mi cable is good converter & charging cable for usb mini- Speaker is average- Bloatware is there but can be disabled ...- 6gm ram and snapdragon processor does the job efficiently.- No hapticsA nice decent phone from Samsung.Pro Tip : Never buy a phone on the basis of whats new always buy on the basis of what you need. You can if you've extra bucks ;)Unboxing will be soon available on YouTube : IemMihir.Don't know but my initial review was deleted and I had to write this again.
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",do not buy this product waste of money,1.0,"As mentioned by Samsung 7000 mh battery but battery drains very fast at the end of day when I am using internet,watching videos. Battery needs to carry for two days at 7000mh but it is not carry one day also. Please do not buy this product. Display is also very bad super amoliad  Display is fake some times video shows red faces. It is not zero edge after full Display video get cutted from the edges of phone display. Speaker sound is third class not upto the mark what we expect from Samsung. Handset provided doubly atmos but when I use headphones also can't find atmos experience. Very bad handset on this range better you can buy Samsung m31s for that.I provide 1 out of 10 ratings for this set. Its a garbage set."

"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",WHY U SHOULD BUY OR NOT THIS PHONE!,5.0,"I purchased it on 18 September on 12:01 pm with no delay as I wanted to buy this amazing phone by Samsung. Surprisingly  it was delivered on the same day within 6 hrs. Now I have used it for almost a week and can give my overview about the phone. I will provide you the main pros and cons of Samsung M51PROS:#SuperAmoledPLUSdisplay believe me it is one of the best display I have ever seen on mobiles. You will love the premium quality while watching video and seeing photographs infact reading on this mobile feels great.#Camera: Amazing camera quality it gives natural colors, dynamic contrast ratio is better than the phones come between the price range of 30 to 40 thousand. Daylight images are just magical. 64mp camera is just awesome. 12mp macro lense gives you amazing details. Wide angle for selfish lovers where you will get most of the function get works automatically. One take picture is just amazing too. I can say you will not get such camera performance  in other phones even if you choose any phone having price beyond 40000.#Battery: Believe me if you are a normal user your battery will not get ended before the third day. If you are moderate users of phone it will give you atleast 2 days of battery backup. And if you are a hard-core mobile user you will not able to drain this battery in one single day.#UserfriendlyOneUI: what a lovely UI, very smooth , no confusing icons, better placement of folders in my files. Categorization of items by samsung is awesome anyone can use this with no difficulty. Your pics, videos, recordings, documents  everything will be kept in right place and believe me it will make you so happy as you don't have to find anything here and there.#Snapdragon730G: what a great thing to have both thing in your phone one the brand Samsung and another the processor snapdragon. Yes this processor  made M51 a great choice. Snapdragon helps to improve your gaming performance plus it also helps in smooth functioning  of different apps. No lag while viewing videos, playing games and making calls.CONSLook these are my point of views may be the cons don't have any value for most of the users.#Size: The size of phone is 6.7inch which can be a bit big for many users especially having small hands. Besides, bike riders who use to go offices daily may find this phone challenging while keeping inside the jeans pocket.#Body: the body of phone is glastik and it is so scratchable that means you have to buy the backcover as soon as possible. Using backcover and tempered  glass is advisable. This is not a big cons as now a days we all use back cover in all phones so don't take it as negative one.Hope you will like the review and it will help you give you idea of purchasing the phone."

"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Great Battery life for almost 3 days,5.0,"I basically bought the mobile only for battery life while I take lot of calls and dont want to keep charging my phone. So this phone I tested for last 4 days and the battery stood for 3 days and 3rd day mid I had to charge the phone. Camera I felt is ok as I could see in full pixels as well the photos when zoomed are not able to capture full clarity images. But that is ok if one does not want to Zoom images and for budget phone you cant expect much as well. Close images are all great with back and front camera clicks. They could have provided earphones basic version with device during this pandemic situation as most of them are at home working and taking calls and use earphones which has become basic requirement. I purchased 256 additional memory card and its working great with the device for additional space. Its become my mini computer to store important documents, videos, music and applications. So I am enjoying my buy as of now with great battery life. I consciously did not buy any Chinese phones as you never know if service will be available in future once India decides to remove Chinese manufacturers slowly in years to come. Overall 5 star for Battery life which was my basic requirement."

"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",OVERALL A GOOD PHONE,4.0,"Overall a good phone. Details below:1) Fingerprint reader is excellent.2) Battery gives a nice back.. 24+ hours you'll get with frequent internet usage. Normal use will give 2 days+.3) Now, the most important thing which is very upsetting is the camera. CLOSE UP SHOTS ARE EXCELLENT!! BUT After clicking Normal image, if you zoom it, the pixel breaks with a bad image quality. But if you don't zoom, it looks fine. + inside home if you click a picture with flash, it gives a very bad quality image mostly with yellowish tone.Sometimes, little bit of heating while charging.I would have given 5 star.. but because of these 2 issues I gave 4 star.I am sure SAMSUNG can fix these issues with a very good software update. Please do it immediately specifically for the camera. I WILL RATE 5 STAR ONCE THESE ISSUES ARE FIXED.Please give an excellent software update which can fix all these issues. + you should have given a wireless headphone with this phone. Thanks."
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Not a great deal,3.0,"this is samsung UI CORE 2.0 platform which means popular samsung feature like samsung pay,secure folder etc are not available. You could get  much better device at this price coz phone dont  have any special feature but basic function only. Screen is quite big and  super amoled. No headphone even at 25000 price. Phone comes with lot of crapy apps like chingari like.Over all disappointed ."
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","It's not overpriced, it is a good phone.",5.0,"Some people are criticizing this phone for being overpriced. But we are a country where unsafe cheaper cars outsell safer built slightly higher priced cars.People compare this phone with Chinese brand counterparts and overlook the fact that their data and security are compromised.For what it's worth this phone comes with the Knox security which is an additional secure hardware, do the Chinese brands offer that?Others complain about its heft. It's lighter than iPhone 11 Pro Max. And it has a bigger battery.My only expectation from this phone is that it remains as snappy over the future updates.Sense UI is a lot better, Knox allows me to have a professional profile independent of personal one. Cameras (both front and rear) and battery are excellent, charging speed is really good. Audio quality, when earphones are plugged in, because of the Dolby Atmos, is phenomenal. Display is very good. The speaker could have been a bit better.Overall, this is a workhorse priced adequately. You may put your trust in it."
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Mobile is best in terms of Battery and Camera.. But hang problem is there.,2.0,"Hi all,Problem : If you play game like COD OR PUBG and suddenly you open camera for Video record of 5min and then when you again open game then when you try to open camera again it stucks.. camera will not open.

I tried a lot still same problem. Then I have to restart it. So before buying it be carefull. Samsung have it's hang issue like they just remain to make it as signature move. in all phones of samsung hang problem is there...And also Price of phone is too high.. just for 7000 Mah don't waste your money..

Badly heating problem while charging and playing games.3. Camera settings are very disappointing.4. Battery is not equivalent to 7000 mah, its like 4000 mah or maximum 4500.5. Network issues.6. Hanging problem even in 6 gb ram7. Stero speakers sounds are below the samsung category,  very disappointing a8. Before buying amazon was committed to deliver it to the next day while delivered by third day.9. Handsfree missing in the box and charger and its cable were just thrown in bmthe box. Their packaging was not done even. There were scrathes found on charger as well as mobile phone.10. In total amazon service is worst as well as Samsung is cheating with customer in quality.

"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Phone is dead after 5 days,1.0,"Used phone for 5 days and then it switched off. Phone is being returned and then money will be refunded. If someone is returning the dead phone make sure you ask the customer care person to mention that phone is dead in the return pick up request as a note otherwise the pick up person will not pick up the phone since he is not able to verify the IMEI number of a dead phone. My phone got picked up in 3rd attempt and refund not issued yet in 10 days. Coming back to phone customer care said many people facing the same issue hence they are refunding instead of replacement. Seems to be a big build/quality issue with main parts of the phone. Camera quality is superb, battery life is ok despite having a big battery. Battery was draining fast."

"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",My M51.,5.0,"Whoah!So I have my celestial black M51 6GB + 128GB right with me. And Amazon was amazing to help me give the best to my Dad.  One word: it's just astounding.It's so sleek and slim and so light to touch.The camera is absolute bliss. It's 64Mp main camera captures shot like a pro. The various features of the camera would definitely replace the different photoshop applications available in the playstore town. The most mind-blowing feature is the single take shot. It's really fun. With one shot you get everything. I repeat everything. The slow Mo and the superslow mo is next wonder in Samsung.Next comes the battery backup. The 7000maH battery life. One entire dayof use from photos videos and ott it ran fully and got drained next day early noon. The 25W charger is just a power factory as it charges the phone in no time. It has a c to c cable meaning both ends are C type. It's unique.The fingerprint sensor is at the best position, i.e. at the side. Power button to be precise.The size is 6.9 inch and it comes properly in hand.I personally feel there are some unwanted applications which are pre-installed. But rest seems to be a good experience.So far it's a good one and my father is very happy with the new phone. And so I am happy too.And yes it's not Chinese. It's made in India.Thank you Amazon and thank you Samsung.😁"
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Don't Buy this phone it is not worth 25K given the limitations.,1.0,"Don't buy this phone because of following reasons.1. Charger : you can only use Samsung charger that came it with this phone, as other C-Type USB chargers won't work.2. Multi user support: Almost all android phone provide multiple user support but this phone doesn't. This is a default feature removed by Samsung.3.  Buggy fingerprint: Fingerprint is not very reachable from both the hands because it is in side. You can only record three fingers this is a big limitation.4.  Battery charging takes lot of time.5.  Data Stealing: Even in this price point, Samsung is trying to capture as much data from you and try to market things. You can not uninstall or disable certain apps from Samsung.6. Low sound quality.7. it is bit bulky because of large battery.8. Because of fingerprint in power button, it is difficult to use button for screenshot etc."

"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Not a monster,4.0,"Very poor quality device by samsung.I think samsung should have to remove the tag of monster. This is my clear review after using it about 15 days and replacing it once and Then returning it to the amazone..Pros....1) battery optimization is zero.I don't think so it has 7000mah battery coz it has same backup as 5000mah battery phones.2) however it has Snapdragon 730G it still struggle to give smooth experience while using social media apps and playing heavy games like pubg,COD etc.3) heating issue during charging.5) cheap body material, it's build by cheap plastic so naturally it gets many scratches on back and front..6) 25k price of this phone but samsung does not provide any cover and earphone..Pros1) display quality is excellent2) camera is quite good as per price3) cool features like AOD(always on display), screen recording with external and internal sound , NFS,quick share etc.Final review- if u are Samsung love and u don't have problem with weight, quality,poor performance then go for it. But if u are concern about these then there are many mobiles in same price range which gives u better performance...Thank you..."
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Too heavy to carry. Unsatisfied.,1.0,"Battery is good, but mobile is very heavy.. not handy for single hand operation.. if you use it continuously then you feel pain in your hand,I brought in first sale, how can we predict the weight without carrying phone in hand. When I ask for return the phone to Amazon executives they replied there is no return policy of this product, you can only replace.My request to Amazon, is it possible to return this mobile, then help me for return...I am not happy with this phone."
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Best mobile you can get - A Monster,5.0,"Well first disclaimer - nothing is perfect in world, so is M51 (or for that matter any other phone). But M51 actually ticks all right boxes at given price. Let me give an honest and personal opinion. Before that let me share that I bought this phone for my college going son. I'm a Note user since last 3yrs, so would be a candid review.Best things :1. Battery - With more and more screen time, you need a reliable battery life. 7k battery gives you excellent juice to do more without draining soon. Charging is fast so far. No heating witnessed.2. Screen - Samsun screens are no doubt the best ones. Super Amoled used here is treat to eyes.3. Camera - truly truly marvellous. I can't just believe the camera department in M51. Sony hardware is well oiled and you get crystal crisp pictures. Amazing pic quality.4. Weight to me is not that bulky given a big screen and bigger battery you need to run that for 2 days, unplugged.Improvement areas :1. Dolby atmos is excellent in headphones but stock speaker could have been better, though not disappointing.2. There are no headphone, cover and screen guard in the box. All that are well informed earlier, so least surprises. Negligible costs and many good options available in market. BTW I use Spigen case and super awesome on M51. very very secure.All in all a very good phone, ticks all compartments right. Go for it w/o thoughts. And the best things, Non Chinese brand. Samsung has come up with one of the largest mobile plant at Noida in India. So another right tick."
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Not upto the mark.,1.0,Phone is overpriced as per the features it offers and also faces so much difficulties during exchange of my old phone due to the untrained delivery staff of amazon. Also the phone doesn't look good as the design is not upto the mark even the phone is priced at 24999/- as compared to the other phone available at this price point.
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Monstrous  fast phone but not so loud,4.0,"Huge battery backup 7000mAh, 64mp Sony camera with other wide angle and selfie camera, fast snapdragon 730g makes the purchase worthy plus the introductory  card offers, although 24k is better bet for provided feature. Samsung should attempt at providing back cover plus screen protector if charging extra bucks extra along with some features of knoxx security( nfc is old)... Side mounted finger print scanner is regular type and not that fast or secure as I expected. Pride of holding an Indian assembled non Chinese phone from a leading global brand, Glad to return back to Samsung as my earlier experience of choppy display and heating  phone was horribleSound volume is not that comparable to a 25k or 27k phone, exclusive C type double ended usb is difficult  in connecting to some other set of devices( may be I'm feeling new as I upgraded from lenovo k6 after 4 years),M51 is a choice for someone not finding enough time to charge in between his day job and this phone charges in just 115 mins approx from 0-100% and about 30-35% in 30 mins . Monstrous capacity even with heavy use"
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Awesome monster!,5.0,"Just got it in my hands a few hours back. The big display and battery are just amazing.  The phone is slightly thick yet very slim when you consider the monster battery. Camera looks good for day photography. Yet to use it in night conditions. First impressions??Awesome for the price!Adding to the previous review.The battery life is great n as advertised.Camera quality is very decent for the price. The fingerprint reader is okayish.Overall, very satisfied with the Monster phone!!"

They just name it blah blah blah....marketing strategy.- Camera focus hunting issues.- Pathetic speaker, neither bass nor clarity and not so loud. Call quality is also not upto mark.-Position of volume button is very inconvenient, it is on the upper half side which causes difficulty in single hand use.-Very bad and thin quality of type C charger cable which can not last longer than a year.-ONE UI:-So far I didn't  find camera shutter sound off button .- noticed no lag in UI but obviously not superfast, feels some stuttering while browsing in play store.- No shortcuts of clock/calendar on notification bar. By clicking  on it, clock/calendar should open, thats very handy.Thats 24 hour user review. I will update my findings accordingly."
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Samsung has lot to Think...,1.0,"Buying phone at 25k, with better than this features available for 18k from Chinese Mobiles companies.. Just coz Samsung not Chinese. But is Samsung misusing Indians sentiments? Then what  when others are providing Gorilla Glass 5 front and Back.. This Samsung is giving plastic back, which easily get scratches and least bothered of phone maintainance. Atleast they could have provided back cover worth of Rs.50/- which is absense. Samsung is so harsh on customer paying 25k for his phone. This will not run for long. We don't brother buying Chinese phone if this attitude continues. Indian need to think. Chinese mobile companies manufacturing mobiles in India.. Also they are giving jobs to our people and many families are running.Why should be bothered, one who doesn't care of their customers."
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Nice phone but overpriced!!!!🤔😅😀,4.0,"I bought this phone(8 gb/128 gb variant)on the very first day of the sale and i got this at 24999/-₹ instead of regular price of 26999/-₹ with HDFC Card offer.... and i think that this phone is somewhat overpriced and the 24999/-₹ should be the real price for 8gb/128gb variant..Now coming to this phone i would like to say that this phone is packed with nice features and a monstrous battery but disappoints in build quality parameter and it has full plastic body and only comes with Gorilla glass 3 protection...Samsung should have given atleast Gorilla glass 5 protection if they didn't want to give glass body but i only bought this phone as i didn't want to buy a Chinese phone and only wanted a non chinese Made in India phone so this was my only option....Now i will give a few Pros and Cons of this after using it for non stop 4 days.....Pros:1. I found that its Camera is good for casual photogaphy with good low light performance,it is the same camera which comes with M31s and i think most of the persons will like its performance..2. It is packed with 7000 mah battery and will last uptp 2 days with moderate use (not heavy gaming)....3. Samumg One UI is awesome with some preloaded application and it also comes with knox security which gives hassle free experience and peace of mind and it is specially optimised for this to work with Snapdragon 730g(although it is cut down variant of One UI which samsung only gives in its flagship phones and A series)..4. Now for the very first time after 2-3 years samsung fixed a Snapdragon processor in its phone and earlier it was giving same old exynos 9611 in most of its phones....it comes with a Snapdragon 730g processor with an antutu score of approx 270k and geekbench score of approx 1700 and performance wise it is very good and one can easily play pubg in ultra settings with 35-40 fps and with 8 gb ram it works blazingly fast and makes multi tasking easier....5.It comes with a 6.7"" AMOLED plus infinity-O full HD display and only downside is that it doesn't comes with Gorilla glass 5 protection and is only 60hz display other competitors give 90hz display with Gorilla glass 5 at the same price...Cons:1. It is made up of only plastic and is susceptible to damage if handled roughly and the side of the phone and even buttons are fully plastic atleast they should have given aluminium finish on buttons and on its sides..2.It has a toned down version of One UI so if someone wants to enjoy its full features then he has to look for A series...and this phone also comes with some bloatwares and also automatically starts downloading recommended application from galaxy store without user permission as soon as it connects internet....3.I think it is priced 1500-2000/-₹ over its real price and which gives chinese phones an edge over it in terms of pricing..4.The phone only comes with an adapter only 25 watts and a type c to c charging cable...i think samsung has tried to cut the cost wherever possible..i think it could have been better if samsung supplied this phone with a back cover and pre applied screen guard with atleast 30 watt charging adapter...Vivo,realme,Oppo etc.all are giving the things that i have mentioned above at the price less than this phone...5.A 90 hz display with Gorilla glass 5 protection could have been better fit for this phone so one should buy a rugged back cover and a decent tempered glass to avoid any damage.....Now i have to say that it is a good phone but it is overpriced and most the of the persons will prefer realme,oppo,vivo etc. But if anyone wants a non chinese phone with a good better User experience then they should definitely look at this phone...."

"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",So Far So Good!! Initial Impressions,5.0,Ok here we go! First review for the meanest monster!I think I was the first who got this delivered from Amazon!So below are my initial impressions:1. Screen - Massive. Simply massive! Great colors and that slight curve edges feel premium.2. Build - Nothing cheap here. Feels sturdy and has good weight distribution. But definitely not for small hands.3. UI - Easy to browse and navigate yet feature rich. Goodness of one UI4. Performance - Already installed around 100 apps. No lag noticed till date. No slowness at all. And I didn't miss 90hz refresh rate!5. Camera - Not much testing with the cam yet. But the selfie cam seems quite interesting. Has great details.6. Battery - Its just 2days but I can see the enormous potential here. Got awesome 9+ hours of SOT on first charge despite all that app download n sync with accounts.7. Network - No issues here. Better internet speed and coverage than my last phone for sure. Call connectivity feels good till nowWill update further by the end of this week.Do comment your questions here if any.

May be it drains faster due to the bigger screen. IT'S NEITHER A MONSTER NOR A BEAST. IT'S JUST ANOTHER PHONE WITH BASIC BATTERY LIFE. NOT WORTH THE MONEY. I WILL RECOMMEND NOT TO GO FOR IT."

My hands are paining  trying to hold the m51 for some 15-20 minutes.Instagram hanged on the 3rd day itself. But now everything is working smooth.Camera is not good for indoor/just ok.Outdoor photos are excellent.Battery life doesn't look like the phone has a 7000mah battery. Max screen on time :14 hrs.Adaptive brightness is bad.Slight glitches while scrolling jn dark mode.I am very unhappy as they slashed the price within a month. I guess the exchange value of the phone will be max. 6000/- after 1 or 1.5 year.Hope samsung doesn't rush in making useless, unworthy phones and make quality budget phones (3 or 4 in a year)."

"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Monster for entertainment,5.0,I have used redmi k20 previously. But the super AmoLED display in this m51 was awesome. Atlast my wish was fullfilled to experience the Samsung's display. That's all because of the Snapdragon 730. If they have choosen Exynos processor again I would have not taken this mobile. And the fingerprint scanner was superfast. It has an super touch response. Just with a small touch phone unlocks immediately. No delays. If you want an mobile for entertainment this was the right choice with big screen. Audio was good. I'm using boat airdopes 441 pro with this mobile. sound effects and quality was awesome.

Exactly one month later the phone wasn't getting charged. After several followups, the Samsung service center confirmed that is the manufacturing defect and warranty will be covered.But it will take 10 days and they don't even have a spare mobile for us to use. I bought a new mobile again to take online classes until I get my mobile back. Samsung should have replaced me with an new mobile as it was identified as a manufacturing defect."
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Samsung M51.,5.0,Its really mean monster. M51 gives me 2 days and 2 nights 🌙 of battery backup because of 7000mah monster battery. It's just 2 days and I have already explored many features of this phone. Big giantic screen and true color captures. Samsung has been known for display and its living upto the expectation.Just small suggestion is to give us phone cover and screen guard as most service providers are giving it.
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Monster mobile.,5.0,"Product is quite superb from Samsung, amazing feature of the phone is the battery,  Lasts me for 3 whole days (with above average usage). Processor is MUCH faster than Exynos. No lags at all. Gaming is superb no lags at all. Camera quality is brilliant.Reverse charging Mechanism works great. Selfies are very good. The phone looks like a note series of samsung, very premium with celestial black color, weight is reasonable. One UI 2.1 is superb, much much better compared to old touchwiz UI of samsung. All the bloatware apps can be easily removed. Much better than china phones."
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Very disappointed,1.0,No satisfied...I brought this mobile from Amazon flash sale ..got it delivered on 19th September 2020...and within 13 days my mobile got shut all of sudden...display is not working....called Amazon they say the return window has got expired so they can replace this mobile...I will have to get it replaced from Samsung Gallery....very disappointing...not expected this from Samsung n Amazon
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Its a beauty alright.. But some bugs present...,4.0,"I bought this phone right at 12 pm on 24th Sep, i.e on the day of release.Display:The display is just beautiful. They say its the sAmoled plus display. It does look better than a sAMOLED display. Brilliant contrast and dark mode just looks beautiful.Camera:Looks promising. Decent pics for the price range. The front camera can give you a digital wide angle, though it does not have a wide angle lens. Software is excellent. Cmon guys, its a Samsung phone.Performance:It has a 730G and it ain't a slouch. No lags. Played COD Mobile at Very high graphics and max frames. There is a nominal heat dissipation after an hour of gaming. Not too intensive.Battery:This is where I was quite surprised. I expected to end my day with Atleast 65% left as my previous realme 2 Pro which has less than half of 7000 mah ended the day with 25-30%. But, though I use dark mode(Which is better for the battery since its an AMOLED display), I ended it with around 45-50%, which actually disappointed me. Hopefully, a software update will fix this.Less highlighting cons:The power button fingerprint scanner isn't quite fast( When compared to my previous realme 2 Pro) and is sometimes buggy..Verdict:It's an awesome phone. These features are unique. It can be your next phone. 😁"
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Superb Mind-blowing top notch classy stylish,4.0,this is one of the best Samsung mid range phone which is not only fast but also stylish.The smartphone does provide very fast and no lagging features due to the snapdragon 730G...I have used this phone full 48 hrs and one think is sure no phone can match the battery or you can say BATTERA of this smartphone.....Camera is also good...u can play games watch videos and do anything but there will be nearly zero lagging in this smartphone....GO FOR 8GB ram variant superb fast

"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","FAULTY PRODUCT, POOR CUSTOMER SUPPORT! BEWARE BEFORE PURCHASING!",1.0,"It gives me immense displeasure and utter disgrace while penning this down that I feel cheated and my money has gone in vain.My 11 days old Samsung Electronics Galaxy M51 which I had purchased from STPL EXCLUSIVE ONLINE SELLER OF SAMSUNG (SAVEX TECHNOLOGIES PVT. LTD.)  had turned out to be dysfunctional. I've been juggling between Amazon customer support and Samsung customer support since last 4 days to get this resolved.Amazon customer support refuses to help since it is out of 7 days replacement window and directs this issue to the OEM.OEM says that amazon is fooling me because there is a 10 days replacement window.OEM On-call & Chat support tells me that they 14 days replacement window and asks me to go down to the service center to get it replaced. Upon reaching the service center they tell me that they can't replace an online purchased device & amazon is liable to change until 10 days of purchase(as per amazon it is 7 days). The service center head refused to give this statement in written. Now, either don't trust AMAZON and it's seller or don't trust the Brand and Manufacturer at all.Now, who is to blamed for all the nuisance? Who is feeling cheated? And guess what, brand loyalty goes for a toss!!!Why OnePlus, Apple have good brand loyalty & advocacy, because of good devices & even better customer support."
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Avoid buying this phone from amazon .worst replacement polocy for faulty product,1.0,Iam facing heating issues while using camera calling and gaming so I opted for replacement but amazon is not allowing for replacement telling product is fine throught their faulty app test even if my phone is burning. I called amazon service many times but there is no use in it . It hurts when you get faulty product  if you spend that much (25k)for mobile .Iam going to file a petition in customer court.
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Satisfied and happy with the product,5.0,"Overall a good phoneThe camera is good. Wouldn't say flagship level but yeah its good. The processor without any doubt is amazing. Gives good performance for gaming or even other daily activities. Phone does not heat much. Played fortnite for an hour still it was not that hot. Side mounted fingerprint is good in this time where the indisplay fingerprint is trending some of us may still prefer the old school stuff. I need not mention about the battery as we all know it is a beast like the 7000mah charged full in the morning with light usage and by the end of the day its still at 75%. Now just so you know you dont get a back cover or earphones in the box but at this price point earphones should have been included(not complaining).Now some of the problems are that at this pricepoint other phone companies are providing a 90Hz display if that were included it would've been way better. And the adaptive brightness doesn't work properly which i think is a software issue, the brightness levels keep fluctuating even in a well lit room, i hope samsung fixes it in the next update this devixe gets.Finally, if you are thinking of buying this phone I will say go for it, without a doubt. Its a beast"

"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Best mobile under 23k,5.0,I have ordered this mobile on the first launch of Amazon sell. I must say that this is complete combo package of all the features you required.Battery. Very long lasting battery comes upto 30 hrs in heavy usage...you can easyly comes 2 days in normal use.Camera.

"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","Too costly, not recommended",2.0,"Phone rear camera quality is good. Front camera, auto focus and zoom on face during video calls. Thus making your face look bigger than normal.Processor is not much better as compared to in M30/M30s/M31/M31s.I installed Asphalt 9 in M51 & M30. I was shocked to see M30 works fast in opening/loading the application.Phone doesn't lag. Too much of pre-installed apps consumed 2.5 GB data on first use.Battery is awesome. A day lasted on standby and consumed 20% of battery only.A liitle big in size. Need two hands to operate.I would recommend to go for M31s"
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Great Display. Great Camera. Great battery.,5.0,Amazing product. Super amoled+ display is the best. All 5 cameras are awesome. Front & rear video stabilization is amazing too. Reverse charging works fine. Also supports NFC. Samsung's one UI gives a smooth fluid feel during usage. It also comes with the basic version of Knox security. 7000 mAh battery and SD 730G seems monstrous but their performances can be judged only after more usage. Fingerprint sensor and face unlock seems pretty fast. But should've given an in-display scanner. Also the plastic body in the back leaves fingerprint marks on it. Also gorilla glass 5 should've been provided. But everything else seems great. The best non-chinese smartphone in this price range.
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Decent Mid Range Samsung Mobile,4.0,"Buy this if you want1) Good battery backup (last around 2 days if fully charged)2) decent processor ( others are offering better processor in lesser budget)3) Excellent display ( one of the best display in this price range and you will definitely enjoy netflix and hotstar on it)4) Need 3.5 mm headphone jack( it matters for some of us)5) only one speaker with decent sound quality6) Call quality is good7) Knox security8) Samsung branding (can easily find lots of service centers near your locality)9) All sensors are provided10) Best Camera in this price range11) No heating issue atleast in my case.12) Fast charging supported.13) Didn't feel any lag while browsing internet ( I don't play mobile games so can't say about that) Not to buy:1) If looks matter to you ( Back of the phone is glastic so it feels little cheap but nice back cover can hide it)2) Knox security is present but no secure folder is provided3) NFC is provided but no Samsung pay available but we can use 3rd party app instead of Samsung pay although it is risky4) No stereo speaker5) Box doesnot contain earpiece so you have to buy that too6) Although Fast charging supported but it takes time  around 1 to 1.5 hrs to fully charge it from completely drained battery7) one UI core ( They have not provided one UI so some features of one UI are missing in one UI core)8) Unnecessary Pre-installed Apps ( but you can uninstall them easily)9) Other mobile companies are providing better hardware in same priceWhom to buy it : Person who need long battery , decent performance and better display can easily go for itAll n all it is a decent mobile :)"
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","Light weight, gigantic battery, versatile processor..and that gorgeous screen <3",5.0,"First thing you notice on this one is that big beautiful 6.7"" Super Amoled+ display. Colors are beautiful and the screen is extremely responsive. For a 7000 mAh battery  it feels feather light and fits well in the hand. The primary camera is amazing and captures sharp images. Other cameras are OKish, macro is decent. So mo and duper slo mo work just fine as long as there's enough light. I mean, I've used SLRs a lot and I know I can't expect a phone to perform like them. Charging is pretty fast and you never seem to run out of battery on this one. I'm a casual gamer and for me games work well. No lags and stutters in switching between apps, everything is fluid and extremely responsive. There's a ton of features in One UI, too many for my liking. The camera interface feels a little messy at times, but that probably because I've switched from MIUI after 3 years. The side mounted fingerprint scanner works well only half the time. Face unlock isn't exactly reliable. The music quality is disappointing ( I used an excellent pair of Sony ear buds that delivered  killer performance on my Xiaomi device ). Loud speaker is decent. No issues with calls and connectivity.Summarizing,  if you're looking for a good device under 25k with a great camera and multimedia experience , want a great overall daily performance and battery backup I can confidently recommend this..P.S:I wasted over 1k on a spigen  case for this. It makes the phone feel like a brick. Very difficult to hold and handle with the case on. Go for the thin ones."
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Overall not satisfied with product.,2.0,"I have purchased M51 during sale. Mobile is little bit bulky, but i used to with it. I personally doesn't like camera output it produces from Sony censor. Image quality is like Oil painted when we zoom photo. Battery life can be extended by disabling extra samsung apps. No issue with finger print and face unlocked. As we compared price with product, i know its brand value but overall price didn't justify product."
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Decent Monster,5.0,"Samsung has packed some decent hardware in this phone, like Good camera setup,powerful battery,good screen.Due to Samsung branding there are few cuts like plastic back, low screen refresh rate.Overall decent phone.👌👌"
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","Massive 7000mah, two days battery...absolute rubbish.",2.0,"Bought the phone the same day it was launched, delivered the next day. I'm a Google Pixel user, so this happens to be my secondary  phone. The main reason to buy was its massive battery but having been using it since the last 3 days,  its nothing even close to massive.  Battery drainage from 100 to 80 in idle condition, a few minutes of web scrolling gets it down to 60 % then 50% in no time, by early next day, it starts to scream for a charge again. I am by choice not a gamer or a heavy user, so use my phone only for calls and a bit of web surfing. This therefore is absolutely unbelievable and shocking to say the least, from a phone with 7000mah battery. I'm wondering if these YouTube reviews are actually paid for or manipulated,  since you hear most of them shouting loud in praise for the phones battery.  Anyway, since the option of return isn't available,  I'll maybe look for a replacement now as a solace, hoping the possibility of having received a defective piece. ( Review update 02/10/2020...received a replacement phone this week after a thorough checkup by a technician on home visit, for my last one, unfortunately the new replaced phone suffers the same battery drainage issue,  doesn't even last for a complete 24 hours on moderate usage, plus it comes with an additional issue of having permanent black shadows on top of its screen. As if one problem wasn't enough, i got two this time. Coming to the battery, 7000mah  seems like a joke played by the samsung chaps. Anyway, I now have no choice left but to seek for another replacement again,  hoping my issue will somehow be resolved once and for all. Though the Amazon guys have so far been really good with their customer service andextended immediate help,  genuinely. (A word of caution for the samsung guys...you may be in for real legal trouble for wrong and misleading advertising,  unless you take up the issue seriously and rectify it immediately)"
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Hulky & Monstrous All Rounder !! 72hrs review !! Worth Every Penny !! Supreme Sammy Mid-Ranger !!,5.0,"I received this beast on 20/Sep and using it for past three days and sharing my very genuine review.Display: 10/10 -  Better Viewing Angles and colour reproduction, minimal bezel, bright, vivid, and smooth responsive. supports HDR, but only for YouTube, Widevine L1 certification, Gorilla Glass 3 protection. overall delightful experience.Camera: 8.5/10 - Very Reliable Cameras !! Rear camera takes detailed shots in all light conditions and selfie color reproduction was accurate, dynamic range was also great. Pretty versatile camera. Still have rooms for improvisation and no OIS !!Software & Performance: 9/10 - No lags, hangs and slowness while switching between apps and handling multitask. It can easily handle everything without any struggle and software One UI well optimized and have tons of features to use and enhance top-notch user experience. The side mounted fingerprint is pretty convenient and works really well.Battery 10/10: Battery life was astounding and able to push a full three-day normal usage with only multimedia streaming and no gaming. With gaming - we were able to push around two days of usage.Audio and call Quality: 9/10 - Single down firing speaker, which is very decent and loud enough. There is also an option to enable Dolby Atmos audio which brings up the overall audio experience. But this works only with earphones and Bluetooth devices. No issues with network reception.Design: 7/10: Device feels heavy and pretty thick at 9.5mm.  It feels solid in the hand and the glasstic back offers better grip and it is not as slippery as other phones with glass back but it can get scratched easily. Although the device feels solid in hand, it is still bulky and hulky to carry around and won't hold it for long time!!Final Verdict: If you're looking for excellent/ballistic  battery life, reliable cameras, great screen, Decent performance, robust chipset (Snapdragon 730G), then M51 is the right choice and best buy as of now !!"
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Excellent Endurance Good Performance,5.0,"Now this phone is something from which you will expect endurance,  performance users will choose to look another way but for an average user who need to travel a lot or maybe who prefers endurance over performance will look this way.Performance is not at all bad but if you are looking for a flagship then purchase OnePlus.The processor is not the best but capable enough to handle all the task thrown at it including games and other stuffs.Camera is more than good and for comparisons better than OnePlus 8's module but without OIS but with EIS for videos.Display is the excellent part of Samsung's kitty as they are able to provide some of the best displays to us.Battery as you may find will easily give you around 10-12 Hours of screen on time over wifi and if you go over network you will find 10-11 Hours of screen on time.Charging the phone will take you off grid by almost 5 or 10 min less than 2 hours but still it charges fast with 25W charger, the same would have increased by Samsung but heat dissipation part had been kept under check.A word of caution though screen protectors and back covers are scarce for the handset in offline market as it is a new phone.Shout out to Amazon for their one day delivery in my area excellent service.Thanks for reading the review guys, please go for 8+128 Gb version as extra doesn't hurts."

Supports upto 2 days for normal use. Normally 3000 or 4000 capacity batteries last only 12 hours or less on Samsung phones. So it's battery performance is satisfactory. For a 8nm processor, I had expected it to give 2 days life with one sim card.Fingerprint is irrelavant for me. I would have considered to use it if it was on screen. Samsung should consider to give finger print on screen like other A series phones.Sound quality and loudness is  satisfactory.Telephone connection and internet connection satisfactory.Overall performance of the phone is good.M-51 has KNOX security system.Many had commented that M series mobiles don't have knox, an essential for security."

You have to enter your pin all the time.And why this nonsense ONE UI @Samsung ? why can't you just keep stock android, it low your cost and you can sell your phones at low cost.Because of this mistake I am giving it one star over all.

"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",JUST READ THE  REVIEW ITS AWSOME PHONE M51✌🤘,5.0,"After 3 days of use i am writing this review.The best phone from samsung at this budget.1.CAMERA- camera is very very good. Rear camera you can use in 64 MP for Full crystal clear photos. Videos, hylerlaps and slomos are very good. MACRO CAMERA AND WIDE CAMERA are also very good. You will enjoy the camera photos.2. Bettery life- From the 20% of charging to reach 80% its just charge in less then 60 minutes . I charge my phone in the morning around 80-90% and i use my phone all the day in online lectures and webinares and my internet is continuos whole the day still at the evening it left with 50-55% charging then again i play the cod mobile at night for 2-3 hours still it lest 25% bettery and another day morning i charge the phone for one hour and it goes to 90% in just one hour. So superb bettery life.Performance - Snapdragon 730G and Adreno 618 GPu gives you outstanding performance and more power saving beacuse of its superamoled plus infinity display. I play cod mobile in High graphics and exterme frame rate but its never lag and phone has no heating compare to other phones. I LOVE THE PERFORMANCE.Display- Everyone know in the display no one can beat the samsung its just awsome for watching movies and also gives you DOLBY Atmos so you will love the watching series and movies on it.I think Paisa vasool phone he guys and made in india he Noida, delhi (samsung's world's largest manufacturing plant) just buy it. You will love it."

"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Superb Product with good offer from Amazon,5.0,"I changed from Apple Iphone to M51. The simple reason was battery. During lockdown with WFH situation, battery has become paramount. Continous charging is reducing battery cycles.Ordered on the first day in the first half an hour after reviewing Nord and Realme 7Pro. Samsung as a brand is strong and in the various battery draining and charging test it was reigning supreme over the other two. Though they charge faster but then they have smaller batteries as well.In all other parameters it has been working without a hitch. The processor is strong and is able to load my office apps. I have truly impressed and delighted. Buy blindly if you are looking for a trustable phone which is a workhorse. I also used the HDFC 2000 off offer so got it cheaper."

Phone doesnt heat up while charging or while watching videos or while playing games. It is a complete value for money deal. Got it for INR 22,999 during the first sale promotion offer.The only thing I didnt like is,1. Samsung is not providing any back cover and head phones. The phone is priced at INR 24,999, it should provide these basic things for such costly phone.2. It is overpriced by INR 3000."
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Adpative Brightness BIG Issue !!!,2.0,Adaptive brightness is Big headache.I updated to latest version but no success.Brightness suddenly reduces big problem.There has to be an urgent update by samsung to fix this.Do not go with review of fake youtubers .
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Perfectly Balanced Phone.,5.0,"The USP of this phone is it's great display, humongous battery and best camera in this segment.Pros--It's display is big and provides good video watching experience with vivid colours.In one charge M51 7000mah battery will last about 2 days very easily and it also charges quiet fast with 25w charger.It's camera is top notch and clicks very good quality images and i can say that M51 has best camera comparing any other phone in this segment.In case of performance also I didn't find any lag the optimization of Snapdragon processor with samsung OneUi is very smooth also it has Knox security that's what makes this phone even more interesting.Cons---Although fews bad things I noticed was the speaker quality is not impressive and it's sound is really low.The back of the phone is decent but catches lots of fingerprint.The adaptive brightness has some issue it flickers a lot between low and high while using it in same light conditions."
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Nothing great about this phone,1.0,"This phone came with a lot of hype and I exchanged my One Plus 5T for this phone. The reason for exchanging my old phone was frequent battery drain on my 5t.However, the firat thing to point out is m51 has a 7000mah battery but in use it does not feel so. My 3yr old 5t required me to charge 3-4times in a day but my new m51 requires a charge once a day, which I did not expect from a brand new 7000mah battery.The touch response is laggy on m51 and I really do not like this after using 5t even though this has a better cpu and 8gb ram compared to my older 5t.The Samsung oneUI is ugly at best when compared to stock android and Oxygen OS.Overall, its just another 25k phone, nothing great about it and this is no game changer."

   Reviews should be honest and unbiased, and I'll live up to this. For me, any smartphone should be reviewed based on what ""should be"" its experience after 1-2 years and not when immediately purchased. But of course, potential buyers will buy it soon after its release - hence I'm reviewing it now based on my 1 week's observation. Will try to keep it short.1. Go through the attached video to see overall exterior features and first look towards the screen fluidity (video was taken from Z1 pro.2. Processor is more than fine for me - 730G is pulling off all my tasks at max speed. Including a lot of games like Clash Royale, Asphalt 9 and others at 45+fps.3. Heating - strangely, phone doesn't heat up during gaming (maybe max 2-3 dgr more) and charging but heats up a lot during prolonged voice calls.4. Cellular call quality & speaker sound o/p quality are at par with any flagship performance.5. Battery calibration - in last 7 DAYS, I've charged it from 0 or 5% to 100% TWICE and haven't charged otherwise at all. I'm getting SoT of 12.5+ hours with medium gaming and a lot of cellular calls. I have uninstalled most of the bloatware except Samsung care and have installed 182 user apps as of this moment.This reading is, given:i. You give up fast charging - disable fast charging from device care menu.ii. Charge your phone while it's switched off.iii. Utilise the phone's default sleep and deep sleep mode configurations to hibernate apps. No need of greenify/ccleaner/avast/bla blaiv. Use device care function to kill background apps when not in use. Use system-wide dark modes as much as possible.v. Don't overuse/abuse power-saving mode.vi. Disable notifications of apps you don't really need.vii. limited Always-On display (on touch only)6. I miss an imp function - call recording from default dialer - struggled a lot to find the right free app - ACR dialer pro for manual call rec.7. I like the Dolby atmos mode on headsets (it's a headset-only mode) but it's not as powerful as some of the other chinese models with Dolby. But all lows, mids and highs are soothing and base is balanced.8. I miss the notification light.9. The entire phone is optimised to let you realise the entire 6800 mAh inside. The refresh and touch sampling rates are low, display dpi is less, core UI 2.0 is perfectly optimised and even the game launcher and plugins don't use many cores. My requirement was never more than a 60hz refresh, so I'm not missing anything here.10. Yes, the ""glastic"" term is a gimmick indeed, but as you'll all use a case at some point of time or the other in the future, the accusation is baseless, I feel. Gorilla glass is again another gimmick - if your phone has to break, it will.11. A small factor but yet an annoying one for me is the rear lens pinhole positioning. 3 of the 4 pinholes are asymmetrically cut and you can notice it easily if you hold the back against the light for at least 5 secs. (check the video). Maybe only for my set, but a factor.12. I had accidentally dropped it (with case and no tempered glass) the next day it was delivered from my trouser's pocket. not even a scratch came anywhere on the plastic or glass parts.13. Except when you expressly want to feel the weight, the set does not ""feel"" heavy. Good weight distribution despite being 210+ gms.14. Side-mounted bio sensor is first time for me but I've gotten quickly used to it - only persistent issue you may face is the notification panel scrolling down while gaming - unless you disable the feature. The sensor is extremely responsive (check video).15. Ambient light sensor - major disadvantage. After the last OTAdate, it's currently using the front lens to sense luminosity, which is battery intensive. And STILL, the screen light flickers randomly. Hoping a very quick OTAdate to handle this. M51 supports Knox3.5  but there is no folder for it provided. Deployment failed.16. Except the depth lens, all the other lenses are working fine for me. The selfie lens could be much better considering its 8mp main sensor - selfie pic attached. The PRO mode steals the game, at least for me though the 12mp ultra-wide lens also doesn't disappoint. The macro lens is fantastic (check pic detail of palm)PROS:1. Dedicated SD slot till 512 gigs2. Awesome battery, no complaints, delivers spec-wise.3. Great SA+ display with deep blacks. I love the warm tinge - tilts it towards reading mode4. Sturdy build despite being plastic - it also accounts for the less weight bcz it's plastic (7000mAh?!)5. Promising 16mp main Sony and 5mp macro sensors6. Performance is top-notch - no stutter, frame drop, fc, thanks to Snappy kyro golds and silvers.7. A finely power-optimised, feature-packed GUI.8. Inbuilt sleep and deep-sleep modes (droid default)9. Super slo-mo, hyperlapse, AR, PRO, single take, live focus, night mode - useful presets present. 4K recording@30fps - super-steady recording.10. UI - system-wide dark mode, wifi calling, NFC, screen recording inbuilt, widevine L1 for FHD clips, fullscreen gestures with hidden nav bar11. It's a ""NON-CHINESE"" smartphone, many system info apps say it's manufactured in Noida - take your call.12. Reverse-charging support is there (usb type c)13. Screenshot shortcut - swipe palm 'edge' from right to left by just touching the screen14. ""Adaptive battery mode"" (droid default) - pls make use of this for more juice15. Samsung paired with mcafee for free malware scan16. Budget-friendly - 24999-3000=21999 - that's the price right now (8/128) with 3k instant bank discount. i got it in a deal of 17k by exchanging RN5 Pro with Rs 7350.CONS:1. Adaptive brightness - still flickers and does so badly - fota needed urgently.2. No Knox folder yet.3. No inbuilt dialer call recording feature4. Carrier aggregation support absent (4G+ ?)5. Selfie/front cam quality below the mark but above avg., not spec-wise6. mono, non-stereo speaker o/p - might be a let down for some of you7. Fast charging is till 25W - might be a let down for some8. no screen protector/earbuds bundled with pack. (I purchased both case and guard in 248 -> 149+99 from Amazon and both are fine quality)9. Avg screen refresh rate (60 Hz) - can be a bugger for who's switching from 90/120/120+ Hz10. Gorilla glass 3 - could have been 5+11. Lens assembly area heats up noticeably during prolonged voice calls (fota?)I've tried to be as unbiased and exhaustive as possible. Please set your priorities to buy this model. Mine were ""NON-CHINESE"", budget, battery, camera, processor and UI."

"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",That is literally cheating your first buyers,2.0,"Firstly how can a phone be available for Rs. 5000 less in just within two months of the launch. This is literally cheating your first buyers for showing confidence in your product.Secondly the battery is so so bad that they should not even mention it in their highlights or promos. If they don't say it is 7000 then there's no way you can conclude its anywhere close to that. Probably the battery optimization is really bad or comoletely missing.Rest Camera is good fingerprint works fine, the phone gets heated when playing heavy games and the samsung keyboard hangs sometimes while typing.Bottomline is 20k is probably a better suited price and next time be more aware of your pricing rather than duping the inital buyers, at least I feel CHEATED."

Speaker is below average,  like 10k phone.5. Facing issues in brightness,5. Proximity sensor not working properly.Pros:1.Battery life is good, but not like 7000mah, it is same as 5000mah battery.2. Screen is good.2. Camera is good.Samsung should provide more features like they provide in A series phone considering price of m51."
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",NOT THAT GOOD AS THEY CLAMINING,2.0,Pros: Display is good.  Battery charge with in 2hrs  Battery last for 1 day with heavy use like  playing games.  Camera is just fine.  Speed of processor is good if we  compared to other this range phones.  Facelock not as fast as iPhone.  Fingerprint unlock is ok.CONS: Selfie camera photos having  pinkishness for skin.  Zooming quality is not good.  When you are a asphalt or pubg like  gamer sometime feel small lag  after ads.  Speaker is not good. It doesn't have  good clarity in sound. Its having only  one side speaker so don't get  surrounding effect.
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Worst Build Quality,1.0,Worst Product for this price range !!!-Back Body Plastic is so bad and cheap has already got scratches in jus one day.-Camera Performance is bad-Build Quality doesnt seem good ast all.-Screen Quality is awesome-Battery & Charging is very good-Performance is good
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Kudos to an amazing mid range phone!,4.0,"Totally loved this piece! Unlike the M31s, the performance on this one is just top notch. It's smooth for a daily usage and I haven't noticed any lag yet. The battery is undoubtedly massive and even on a heavy usage, manages to last for a full day. Camera is pretty decent and the quality of the images are high.The only drawback I face, is with the speaker. It could have been far better. They managed make the audio crisp and clean, which is beautiful.. but the volume only goes so far even on its highest level.That's where I'm taking a star away. Otherwise it's 5!"
