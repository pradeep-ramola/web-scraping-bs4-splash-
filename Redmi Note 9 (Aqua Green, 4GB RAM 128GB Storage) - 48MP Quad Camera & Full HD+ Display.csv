"Redmi Note 9 (Aqua Green, 4GB RAM 128GB Storage) - 48MP Quad Camera & Full HD+ Display",Don't buy. Reviewed on 31.10.2020,2.0,Here my product review after usage of 3 months.Cons:If you bought this mobile you can't exchange. I have tried but not able to exchange my device.Please check by clicking the exchange option and you can take the decision.Now you can understand why you should not by this mobile.Gaming - Mobile heating and lagging when you playing high graphics gameBattery - 5020mAh battery. Moderate performFor charging it's take 2.4 hrs per day from 0 to 100.Macro camera - useless featureFront and Rear camera - Not good compare with realme 6000rs mobile camera.UI is fine but consuming more ramMany pre-installed application could not able to delete ( Mi app).I suggest please buy some other brand don't waste your money like me.

For 13k I thought of getting realme 6i but the stocks barely last..!So I decided to get this phone. The phone is great and smooth. Gaming experience is also good but not as good as g90t.G85 is a decent processor with great daily life performance!If 12k is your budget go for it..Or 13k..realme 6i and 14k... Go for poco m2. Scarlet red looks stunning!!

"Redmi Note 9 (Aqua Green, 4GB RAM 128GB Storage) - 48MP Quad Camera & Full HD+ Display",Not good like other phones of xiaomi.,3.0,"My Mobile phone has some screen issue. On completely black wall paper or black background there's a permanent white dot (like screen is defective) on the screen but i requested for the replacement soon device will be replaced. Although device is preety average, ram management is not that good.go for the snapdragon rather than mediatek.Pubg lags sometimes on medium settings and there's a ton of preloaded apps from which some apps you cannot uninstall.there are several options in the market other than xiaomi. So,choose your device wisely."
"Redmi Note 9 (Aqua Green, 4GB RAM 128GB Storage) - 48MP Quad Camera & Full HD+ Display",Excellent choice at this price,5.0,"Hi I am writing this review post usage of 7 days,1. The Dsiplay is perfect better than Samsung M21 in the similar price range. The display is Full HD+ whereas its counter parts are not offering that.2. The camera scores over its counter parts whereas not much variations available in Selfie but fantastic at this price.3. The specifications are more or less similar to Mi Note 8 except the processor, it's Helios G85 in this one whereas its Qualcomm in Note 8 i.e 625.4. Note 8 had 4K video capture option but not with the latest  Note 9.5. The battery stays long as promised as I am not a gamer the battery lasts for over a day and half.6. This had P2i protection towards splash but not with Note 8.7. To conclude I shall recommend this phone as no brands available at such good price.Thanks for reading god bless . Enjoy"

"Redmi Note 9 (Aqua Green, 4GB RAM 128GB Storage) - 48MP Quad Camera & Full HD+ Display",Fedup in the very first day.,2.0,Looks premium and mi claims that it has quite a lot of features. Has a better IR blaster for remote accessibility. Only the camera is the best in the price range and other aspects it‚Äôs a Piece of shit.Kindly don‚Äôt buy Becoz it‚Äôs worth only for 8-9k Move to Samsung or any other phone. Fedup with the performance of the phone in the very first day. The 2stars are only for the camera Quality and IR blaster. Phone lags much and Gaming performance is too poor and way of handling this phone requires a lot of patience as it loads for longer time for some of the app details. Battery last better and Camera quality is good that‚Äôs all. Not worthy for 13.5k.Pls don‚Äôt buy it if you expect performance from this phone or if you think you can have better features phone.
"Redmi Note 9 (Aqua Green, 4GB RAM 128GB Storage) - 48MP Quad Camera & Full HD+ Display",üôÑRedmi changed lifestyleüòéü§≠ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,5.0,"I brought this phone for my youtube channel review,I thinks that it's a great part product for me because it's Four cameras on the back, punch-hole on the front , camera is perfect, It's me changed my status and one of the best phone i ever had review in last few days  phone capacity 128GB killer memory, Good battery it last 1 to 2 days with normal used. However, Mobile legend has a lot of frame drop when you set it into High Graphic but still manageable when you set to medium graphic. So sad, I thought this is much better compared to lasted redmi phones,The quad-camera setup is almost the same as on the Note 9S but with one small difference - the 5MP f/2.4 camera has been swapped for a 2MP f/2.4 one with autofocus, which is a very welcome feature because it makes macro photography that much easier.The main camera has been borrowed - 48MP with f/1.8 aperture as well as the ultra-wide unit - 8MP with f/2.2 aperture. The ultra-wide's sensor is quite small measuring at 1/4.0"" with 1.12¬µm. And, of course, the 2MP depth sensor, which serves more of an aesthetic purpose than functional one.Ôº∂ÔΩâÔΩÑÔΩÖÔΩè ÔΩíÔΩÖÔΩÉÔΩèÔΩíÔΩÑÔΩâÔΩéÔΩáUnfortunately, the phone supports video recording only up to 1080p at 30 fps. There aren't many modes in which you can shoot in either. A cinematic aspect ratio is available to add some dramatic effect to the video, but that's pretty much it.The Full HD video itself is a bit on the soft side and the dynamic range seems a bit too narrow. You can't see anything in the shadows and clouds in the sky are just a tad brighter than they should."

Even if you cover the camera and take photo, these pixels come out white colours.Other than that, everything seems nice. I used a program to uninstall all the crap Xiaomi bloatware from my phone, (like mipay, cleaner, micommunity, etc).As a result I don't see any ads.I play asphalt 9, game runs smoothly in playable fps.Processor Helio G85 is same as G80, nothing extra.Mi UI is crap. My last phone was Mi A1, which had stock android. Can't understand why Xiaomi, oppo, etc spend money in developing these crappy skins. Stock android is best.Final thoughts: Good phone to use for 1 year, 2 at most. Price could have been 1k less.Looking forward to buy pixel 4a next year when price comes down."

The battery is good and lasts sufficiently according to usage.The only issue I found that it is pre-installed with a 'Get Apps' app from where you have to download and update your apps while Google Play Store seems not to work at all in it. You will not even find many Google apps in the pre-installed app. Besides that you will be consuming your internet data faster with this phone , you know that."

"Redmi Note 9 (Aqua Green, 4GB RAM 128GB Storage) - 48MP Quad Camera & Full HD+ Display",Sensors problems,1.0,"I'm aware that when your colour mode is set to auto, the contrast can get really high in sunlight to make the display easier to see. I'm personally not a fan of this feature, so I turned it off on my previous phone.Now I've got the Redmi Note 9  with MIUI 11, but even after setting the colours to default, the contrast still changes in sunlight. What's worse, it tends to ""spas out"" when in a car for instance. It seems that the sensor/software is confused whether or not the contrast should be increased or not, so in the end the display starts to almost flash by continuously lowering and upping the contrast.I've tried restarting the phone, and turning the auto colour feature on and off. The problem still persists. Not sure if this is a bug or not. And if it's not a bug, is there a way to turn the feature off completely?"

They just wanna sell the products, but with minimal to no cover for any faults/damages. SHAME on AMAZON.THIS PRODUCT IS NOT WORTH BUYING."
"Redmi Note 9 (Aqua Green, 4GB RAM 128GB Storage) - 48MP Quad Camera & Full HD+ Display",Value of money,4.0,"Xiaomi Redmi Note 9: Design and displayThe smartphone comes with what the company calls the Aura Balance design. It is the same design that Redmi Note 9 Pro and Redmi Note 9 Pro Max features. Back of the phone has a glossy finish making it reflective. Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 comes in three colour options: Pebble Grey, Arctic White, and Aqua Green. The review unit we got was the Pebble Grey colour variant. The phone looks good and sturdy, and will not disappoint you in terms of design.  You will also see a rectangular-shape cut out on the rear side housing the camera bump along with the fingerprint scanner. LED flash is placed beside the camera system. To the right side of the phone are the volume control buttons along with the power button. The SIM card tray is placed at the left side. Redmi Note 9 offers 2+1 card slots -- one for microSD card and two for SIM card each.Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 is equipped with 3.5mm headphone jack placed at the bottom edge. The phone comes with a USB Type-C charger. The charging port is also placed at the bottom along with speaker grills and a microphone. On the top edge of the phone is the IR blaster.  The smartphone features a 6.53-inch punch-hole display with 1080x2340 FHD+ resolution. The punch-hole housing the front camera is placed at the top-right corner, thus it hardly obstruct the viewing experience on Redmi Note 9. The display is a strong point of the phone. It provides sharp colours with adequate brightness. Viewing angles are good too.Despite its glossy back, the phone offers a firm grip. The smartphone feels sturdy and durable and can be easily used with a single hand.  Xiaomi Redmi Note 9: PerformanceRedmi Note 9 comes powered by MediaTek Helio G85 octa-core processor with a maximum frequency of 2.0GHz, a GPU frequency of 1000MHz, and up to 6GB of LPDDR4X RAM. There is a 4GB RAM variant of the phone as well. The handset comes in two storage options: 64GB and 128GB. The MediaTek processor can easily handle day-to-day usage without giving you much to complain about.Considering, Redmi Note 9 is a budget phone, our hopes were not much high about the speed and performance of the device. The loading speed of the apps was reasonably good. Switching between multiple apps was easy. Gaming experience too will not be a disappointment. However, there were heating issues with the device after prolonged gaming or long streaming hours. But again, that‚Äôs acceptable at the price point.  Xiaomi has packed Android 10 with a layer of MIUI 11 on the top in the Redmi Note 9 phone. As with other Xiaomi phones, this device too comes with much pre-installed bloatware. These include apps like the Mi Credit, Helo, Mi Community, Zili and more. Some of the apps have already been banned by the Indian government. One can always uninstall them as per their own choice. What struck us is that the phone suggests you download a few more apps even during the setup process. But that again is an individual‚Äôs choice to install or not.Moving on, the phone‚Äôs UI is typical of any Redmi phone. If you are using a Redmi phone, you may find it easy to use the phone simply because of the familiarity. Also, you get spam notifications on the device.Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 comes with a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner and Face Unlock technology for security and privacy of the device. Both worked well for us. The unlocking speed with both these security features was acceptable and just to the phone‚Äôs price.Xiaomi Redmi Note 9: CameraIn continuation of the trend these days, Xiaomi has introduced a quad lens camera system at the back with the Redmi Note 9. The phone offers a 48MP primary rear camera paired with three other sensors- a wide-angle lens, a macro lens and a depth lens. Again, there is not much new about the camera app and its UI. However, the company has added a separate Documents mode to Redmi Note 9 which can be used to scan important documents and papers. Considering the CamScanner app is no longer available, this is an important addition.The 48MP camera does justice to the object being captured. It is able to retain details and true colours more or less. However, the noise creeps in when you use the wide-angle lens. The sensor offers 8MP Ultra wide sensor with 118-degree field-of-view. Photos clicked were low in quality and lack detail."

I didnt like this product at all reason listed below.(1) - In one day use I saw that battery is not upto mark, it drains swiftly.(2) - Camera so called 48mp is poor than realme 5i or even than redmi 8. Camera flash is very low. Display is not smooth.(3) - No charger cable was there in box.(4) - packaging was not good.And the last I was expecting made in India product and am given made in China mobile.Pathetic."

"Redmi Note 9 (Aqua Green, 4GB RAM 128GB Storage) - 48MP Quad Camera & Full HD+ Display",Fraud return policy be careful( you cannot return of phone is defective also),1.0,No return policy. Its fraud. You cannot return phones even if you received defective piece from amazon.I bought this phone today and  found issue of blur videos and voice not clear and when i went for return. They didnt give you an option to return. Instead Amazon will send technical person to look into it after 2 days means you cannot buy another phone and have to manage with this yourself. So please while buying any electronic item like phone. Must read Amazon return policy. Earlier it was not like that. Bad expereince. Shall inform to consumer court also for this amazon fraud. Please please don't buy phones or electronic item from amazon

Amazon delivered it quite early....Hats Off!!!Phone looks great, can't complain about anything....I'm not really a mobile phone guy, but the phone feels pretty premium. The back looks like glass even though its plastic. 6Gb/128Gb seems like an awesome combo at 13,999/-. Was using a Redmi 4, and according to me Mi phones are pretty rock solid as my Redmi 4 has lasted for 4 years and is still running strong.Really don't care about the processing power, 2Ghz is good enough. Camera takes good and clear pictures, not like a DSLR, but good enough for social media.Cons, I feel the Fingerprint reader slightly lags sometimes. The phone is too big according to me(but its kind of a trend), but its my opinion and I come from a generation where smaller phones were better supposedly.Well then, hope it survives the test of time."

Camera quality is inferior as compared to other Redmi phones. It doesn't work in low light.3. Fingerprint lock is not working.4. WiFi connectivity is very poor. It doesn't catches if I try to connect it from a distance. Whereas other phones get connected.5. It comes with a lot of junk apps. You have to spend some time to remove them. Many of them can't be removed.6. When listening to music, the sound quality is very poor. Go for Motorola if you want good sound quality.7. The screen size is good.8. Face recognition works excellent.Overall an above average product from Redmi."

"Redmi Note 9 (Aqua Green, 4GB RAM 128GB Storage) - 48MP Quad Camera & Full HD+ Display",Go for something else - not recommended,3.0,"Bought this coz nothing else was available as all phones are on selected sale dates.I got the mi ui 12 update on this, phone does show signs of sluggish behavior, after the update.There are many who have reported defects in the redmi note 9 series phones with related to camera accumulating dust and wifi issues,I have not got such issues yet, what i have faced is some touch issues on browser or while scrolling youtube, sometimes auto scrolls or blocks my scroll. started happening after the miui12 udpate.Battery draining faster after miui 12.Charger is 22 watts but phone is charging at 18 watt only, to be udpated by MI by software as per reports.it takes 2 hrs to fully charge.As far as phone is concerned, its ok , camera video quality is bad coz its not sturdy it keeps readjusting focus.It does click good pics.Day to day work on this phone was good, heavy mails would render and open faster. mi ui is customizable, you can hide the notch.There is no notification light.Processing is fast. but not a gaming phone .....period !!!!Pubg was sluggish and few others would crash. may be mediatek processor is not as good as snapdragon.Or that mediatek decided g85 was a stupid release and introduced 90 and 95 series.g85 doesnt have any upper hand to g80 in any aspect, so you could prefer redmi 9 prime or poco which is on g80 and 2k cheaper.Speaker volume is low and display is not that bright,Would not recommend to buy this, there are more options available."

Some might say that add 1000 to your budget and buy and get realme 6i and then again someone will some add another 1000 and get samsung m21, as it has a bigger battery and a AMOLED display and this chain keeps on going.So just buy whatever your budget lets you too.You'll not be dissapointed.And remember ""It's not that the good phones have got cheap.

"Redmi Note 9 (Aqua Green, 4GB RAM 128GB Storage) - 48MP Quad Camera & Full HD+ Display",Poor Quality Phone - NOT RECOMMENDED,2.0,Screen quality and build is pretty ordinary. Samsung M31 provides a much better quality phone at an incremental cost of just 2K with all the features. I think this is the reason they just sell this phone via flash sale so that a user doesn't get time to think.

The display is large and crisp, making games and movies look good.üëç But the sound quality is less.I got that issue in my phone.For the price, the 8MP ultra-wide-angle camera also does a decent job.

"Redmi Note 9 (Aqua Green, 4GB RAM 128GB Storage) - 48MP Quad Camera & Full HD+ Display","Great phone, but a tad overpriced.",5.0,"Been using this phone for over a month now, and have shifted from a Redmi. Bought it on sale with exchange, so the total price was under 20k. I am a moderate user - mostly using it for social media, videos, and reading, and use it about 4 hours a day. I don't play games nor do I use particularly battery/RAM heavy apps.Pros:-Sleek and modern appearance. Heavy-ish, but I like that.-BATTERY life. With moderate usage, my phone easily lasts three days, max four without charge.-Amazing, sharp display. Other phones seem quite dull in comparison-Fast, no lags, smooth interface. Easily switches between tasks and apps without slowing down.-Amazing camera (BUT front camera can add a lot of redness to the face, and the back camera can get a bit grainy in low light)-Customisable appearance and skins (not a fan of Samsung's in-built OS look)-Quick face and fingerprint scanner (but the location on the side can be a slight nuisance if you're just trying to hold the phone when not in use. You get used to it.)Cons:-Glasstic back attracts a LOT of scratches and fingerprints, so if you are particular about that (I'm not), you'll need a cover.-Sound and sound quality could be better and louder.Meh:-OS and features. OS is fairly similar to the original Android, and there are not a lot of cool features and little details that I found were there in my Redmi.Overall, I kind of love the phone. The cons aren't really deal-breakers for me, but I do think for the price they could have worked a bit more on the OS and the features. All other specs are great. I'm hoping to use it for a few years at least."

(1/5)* Battery - For the first month it was going great. But now a days, I just play 40-50 mins of games, & use Instagram for 30 mins. Except that I don't use my phone much.

"Redmi Note 9 (Aqua Green, 4GB RAM 128GB Storage) - 48MP Quad Camera & Full HD+ Display",Good buy in this budget,4.0,Good looking phone with 5000mah battery... If your main aim is battery and display this is a best choice. Camera is average to decent that you can expect in this price segment. Phone design though looks very premium and nice to hold.UI is easy to use and touch sensitivity is responsive.The phone lasts easily over two to three days for a casual use which is massive. Normal usage lasts more then a day with still half juice remaining.Those who love long battery life will enjoy

Moderate perform) For charging it's take 2.4 hrs per day from 0 to 100. I think MI mentioned just for advertisement.Macro camera - useless featureFront camera - 8.5/10 (Good)MIUI is fine but consuming more ramMany pre-installed application could not able to delete ( Mi app). It's very offensive and disturbance.  4/10BestNormal user you can go (If you are ok to charge twice a day).If you are a game addict this product not at all suitable for you.IR sensor is best in *Redmi*"

Firstly would like the phone colour. The finger print scanner & face unlock works awesome. Phone features are good at this price range. If you have recently switched from IOS to andriod then it could be a good budget smart phone to start.But this phone I see it is showing manufactured in China. It somewhat made me to think again. I think Redmi are now getting manufactured in India. Any how I am using for casual way but still giving good battery backup and it colud last stand for 2 days easily if you are not a heavy game user. Please make the purchase by looking the manufacturer. It is been more than week and using phone like butter with no issues yet. I would update one more review soonThanks & Happy shopping,Karan"

  ¬†Satisfied with this purchase.Pros :1. Sensors are amazing....!!!  I haven't seen these kind of awesome sensor activity in any phone ever. (I've attached face unlock video just see it u will be stunned)2. Value for money is 100%. Flipkart charges nearly 14.5k for this phone set. Very affordable price at amazon. Thanks amazon.3. Fast delivery and wonderful packing.4. OMG charging is lit. Charges to full 1.3 hrs (approx).Cons :1. Life not up-to 5020 mah. Even realme 4300 mah phone gives a better battery life than thisNote : This phone has Hello G85 processor so load on the system also leads to a Low Battery life.2. Even though camera is decent, it doesn't look like 48 megapixel camera. All the other features of camera like slow motion etc. are good.2. Over colour blending eliminates the feeling of reality in pictures.Finally verdict : This is a perfect package for the type of people who only want a phone for daily life usage and without heavy gaming (u can game for 3-4 hrs tho but drains battery life)Thanks amazon for this wonderful package."

"Redmi Note 9 (Aqua Green, 4GB RAM 128GB Storage) - 48MP Quad Camera & Full HD+ Display",DO NOT BUY THIS MOBILE WORST MOBILE DEVICE EVER EXISTED,5.0,I'm rating 5star because Amazon won't show 1 star reviewsThis phone has serious heating issues even when its in Idle state. Camera quality is very bad don't be attracted for 48 megapixels it's not worth it. The images are grainy and not good quality. In short DON'T BUY THIS PHONE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. AS AMAZON WILL NOT RETURN THIS PRODUCT THEY WILL PROVIDE REPLACEMENT WHICH IS BASICALLY USELESS BECAUSE YOU'LL GET ANOTHER UNIT OF SAME DEVICE WHICH WILL HACE THE SAME PROBLEMS.
"Redmi Note 9 (Aqua Green, 4GB RAM 128GB Storage) - 48MP Quad Camera & Full HD+ Display",Very good but information is important.,4.0,"Some times screen is blinking and a white colour type of horizontal line appears on the bottom or top of the screen while using the device. And heating problem persist while using for some time. This type of problems will not pesists in any other models of xiomi. All others features and functions of this phone is good but for the appearance of one problem makes a model bad which makes customers discouraging and disappointing before buying this model of redmi. So i feel that solve this problem as soon as possible because it is a newly launched model of redmi. So, be smart and be safe."

"Redmi Note 9 (Aqua Green, 4GB RAM 128GB Storage) - 48MP Quad Camera & Full HD+ Display",A local bazar product from india.,2.0,My family and friends circle we are using redmi from Note . Camera clarity is unaccepted from redmi. 48 MP Rear camera looks like 13 MP camera. For 12k they can give a better quality. Redmi note 4 is better than this. Redmi will loose the market if they offer this kind of quality less products.

May it good or bad .The phone i got was not good in battery . No warranty card was in box and even the plastic case which cover the screen was there even when my another same model phone haves . Looking like old renewed peice and again packed . high Battery draining with very low use of normal apps within 18 hrs after 100% . While product have a battery performance . Phone hanging too much . In low performance games it was lagging . In starting it looking good but after 3-5 days it starts problems . I thought to replace it but only in fear that if i got again more worst phone than it so i adjusted . I recommend  all you it is like gambling . May you phone work supernice or very bad . I recommend you so buy samsung , realme, vivo phones instead of chinese redmi"
